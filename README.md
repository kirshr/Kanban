# Kanban
Kanban is a project management application developed using **MERN** (MongoDB, Express, React and Node). The design of the application comes from a "guru" level challenge from **www.frontendmentors.io**. Using a Figma design file I created the application as close to the design as possible.

## THE CRUD of it all
Kanban uses REST APIs to manage CRUDE actions. Currently, the app can Create, Read, and Update. The Delete functionality is coming soon!

### Still to do!
While most of the functionallity is still there, there are still quite a few things that need to get finished:
1. Responsive design (currently only desktop view looks good)
2. Optimizing the code (This is an ongoing process as I learn new techniques and better ways of doing things)
3. Delete API
4. And probably more that I can't think about just yet.

# What have I learned!?
This has been a fantastic project to sink my teeth (hands?) into. Because there is no tutorial or direction, only a design file, it has been an incredible learning opportunity for me.

### Some of the things I have learned:

> Full Stack Development with MongoDB, Express and Node!
> I knew I wanted this to be a Full Stack App, so I dove into the MERN stack, creating both a server side and a client side, then used Heroku to deploy both the server and the client.
